# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the portfolio website to ensure smooth animations and scrolling.

## Scrolling Optimizations

1. **Native Smooth Scrolling**: Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` to HTML element
2. **React-Scroll Integration**: Implemented react-scroll for efficient section navigation
3. **Passive Event Listeners**: Added passive scroll event listeners to prevent blocking the main thread
4. **IntersectionObserver**: Used for efficient viewport detection instead of scroll events

## Animation Optimizations

1. **Reduced Animation Complexity**: Simplified animations and removed unnecessary effects
2. **GPU Acceleration**: Added transform: translateZ(0) to force GPU rendering for animations
3. **will-change Property**: Used will-change for elements that animate frequently
4. **Reduced Motion**: Added media query to respect user preferences for reduced motion
5. **Lazy Animation Loading**: Using LazyMotion from framer-motion to load animations only when needed

## Image Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Added loading="lazy" to images
2. **Image Placeholders**: Implemented a lightweight placeholder system while images load
3. **Optimized Image Component**: Created a dedicated OptimizedImage component for better performance

## Component Optimizations

1. **Component Memoization**: Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Simplified Styling**: Reduced CSS transitions and animations
3. **Smaller Button Size**: Reduced project view button sizes for better mobile experience
4. **Reduced Padding**: Adjusted padding for project cards especially on mobile
5. **Removed Animations**: Removed animations from project descriptions and headers

## Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization

1. **LazyMotion**: Using framer-motion's LazyMotion for code splitting
2. **Modern React API**: Using concurrent mode features for smoother UI updates

These optimizations significantly improve the overall performance, making the website feel snappier and more responsive.
